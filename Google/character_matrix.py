 You have a character matrix and in the cell L(left), R(right), U(upper), or D(down) had written, and as the character says you can go from current cell to written direction but you canâ€™t go outside the matrix then he asked me the following questions.

1) You are at (0, 0) can you reach (r-1, c-1) (r and c are numbers of rows and columns).

2) The minimum number of changes required to reach (n-1, m-1) from (0, 0), and in one change you can change any character to any other character in any cell.
